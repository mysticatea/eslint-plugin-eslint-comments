# disallows unused `eslint-disable` comments (eslint-comments/no-unused-disable)

- 🌟 The `"extends": "plugin:eslint-comments/recommended"` property in a configuration file enables this rule.

Since refactoring or a bug fix of upstream, an `eslint-disable` directive-comment may become unnecessary.
In that case, you should remove the garbage as soon as possible since the garbage may cause to overlook ESLint warnings in future.

This rule warns unnecessary `eslint-disable` directive-comments.
